## Assignment Details

This repository contains the code and documentation for **Home Assignment‚ÄØ4** (Chapters‚ÄØ9‚ÄØ&‚ÄØ10). The tasks focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), including preprocessing, named entity recognition, attention mechanisms, and transformers.

### Tasks Covered

| Question | Topic                        | Brief Description                                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Q1**   | NLP Preprocessing Pipeline   | Tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming using NLTK.           |
| **Q2**   | Named Entity Recognition     | spaCy-based NER system that identifies and labels named entities.  |
| **Q3**   | Scaled Dot-Product Attention | Manual implementation of scaled dot-product attention using NumPy. |
| **Q4**   | Sentiment Analysis           | HuggingFace pipeline to classify sentiment of a given sentence.    |
